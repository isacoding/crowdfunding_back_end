# MentHub: Tech Mentor Matching Platform for Women in STEM

## Project Description

MentHub is a mentorship platform aimed at empowering women in STEM by providing a space for mentors and mentees to connect, share experiences, and foster professional growth. Through structured mentorship opportunities, MentHub facilitates career development and knowledge exchange, bridging the gap between experienced professionals and aspiring women in the STEM community.

## Concept and Name

MentHub was chosen as the name for the platform because it conveys the core idea of mentorship and community in a sleek way. The goal is to establish a hub for collaboration and growth for women navigating their careers in STEM fields.

## Target Audience/User Stories

### Women in STEM:

- Looking for guidance, mentorship, or professional advice to advance their careers.
- Seeking project-based mentorship to support specific learning objectives or professional growth.

### Women Transitioning into STEM:

- Wanting guidance on how to transition into tech or a STEM career from another field.

### Mentors:

- Experienced professionals eager to share their expertise and give back to the community by mentoring others.

## Key Features

### Mentor and Mentee Profiles:

- **Mentors** can create profiles detailing their areas of expertise, availability, and mentoring preferences (e.g., one-time catch-ups, three-month projects, or long-term mentorship).
- **Mentees** can build profiles showcasing their career aspirations, skills they want to develop, and professional background. Additionally, mentees can showcase specific projects they are working on and seek guidance or mentorship for these projects. This allows mentors to see not only the menteeâ€™s personal journey but also the tangible work they are currently focused on and need help with.

### Project-Based Mentorship:

- Mentees can create projects that outline the skills they wish to learn or develop, their career goals, and the mentorship hours needed to achieve these objectives.
- Mentors can view these projects and pledge a set number of hours to support them. A project can receive pledges from multiple mentors, making it a collaborative learning experience.

### Flexible Matching and Communication:

- Mentors and mentees can connect regardless of geographical location through the platform, enabling virtual mentorship.
- Users can filter profiles and projects based on:
  - **Location**
  - **Expertise**
  - **Area of Interest**
  - **Availability** (e.g., short-term, long-term, or one-time)
  - **Industry Focus** (e.g., software development, data science, engineering, etc.)
  - **Skills Offered** (for mentors) or **Skills Needed** (for mentees)
- These filters ensure users find the right match that aligns with their mentorship preferences and career aspirations.

### Mentorship Pledges:

- Mentors can pledge hours to projects that align with their expertise and availability.
- A pledge includes the number of hours offered and is linked to a specific mentorship project.

### Real-Time Notifications:

- Notifications for new mentorship requests, updates on pledged projects, and important platform announcements to keep users informed.

## Database Schema

The database schema has been simplified to support core functionalities and reduce complexity. The platform is built around three primary tables: **User**, **Mentorship Project**, and **Pledge**.

## Next Steps

1. Implement advanced search options for a more refined user experience.
2. Enhance the notification system for more personalised updates.
3. Develop a dashboard for users to track mentorship progress and feedback.
